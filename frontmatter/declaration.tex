\chapter{Declaration of authorship}

This thesis consists entirely of my own work, except for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \Cref{fig:epsi_jnd_mf_jnd_kt,fig:epsi_jnd_mf_jnd_zd,fig:epsi_jnd_mf_jnd_trace}, which illustrate data acquired by Corentin Jacquemmoz and \JND{} at the University of Nantes; and
    \item \Cref{sec:poise__esrpoise} on ESR-POISE, where all experimental data were acquired by, and a portion of the code written by, \JBV{}, David Goodwin, and William Myers, at the University of Oxford.
        In particular, the data used for \Cref{fig:esrpoise_comp} were acquired by \JBV{}.
\end{itemize}

These contributions are also explicitly indicated within the text.

This work has not been submitted, either wholly or substantially, for any qualification at this or any other institution.
