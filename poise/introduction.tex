\section{Introduction}

The paper\autocite{Yong2021AC}

The POISE chapter is likely to very closely follow the publication.
This is the most self-contained section of my work---the only difference I want to do is to point out limitations, or cases where things didn't work as well.

Introduction should probably cover a bit more optimisation theory, e.g.\ Nelder--Mead. It doesn't have to be too formal but I should probably explain the differences between the algorithms.
