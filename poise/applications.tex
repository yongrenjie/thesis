\section{Applications}
\label{sec:poise__applications}

In this section, I cover a number of scenarios in which POISE can be used.
These are generally ordered from simple to complex, and progressively show how the features in POISE can be used to customise optimisation procedures.

All POISE optimisations run in this chapter were performed five times to check for potential reproducibility issues.
Due to noise in the cost function, these optimisations are not deterministic, and the optima obtained typically span a range.
Where possible, this range is quoted in all the results shown in this chapter.
