\chapter{POISE}
\label{chpt:poise}

This chapter describes the development of a piece of software for on-the-fly optimisation of NMR experimental parameters, titled POISE (\textit{Parameter Optimisation by Iterative Spectral Evaluation}).
POISE is primarily written in Python 3, and includes an interface to Bruker's TopSpin, allowing optimisations to be started directly from the TopSpin command line.
Through this optimisation process, NMR acquisition parameters can be adjusted for individual spectrometers and samples, which may vary greatly in their properties: this ultimately leads to improved spectral quality.

In this chapter, I first provide some details about the implementation of POISE.
The bulk of the text which follows is devoted to a number of applications in solution-state NMR spectroscopy.
At the end, the extension of the concept of on-the-fly optimisation to ESR spectroscopy is also briefly discussed: I contributed code for this, but the experimental ESR work and data analysis were carried out by \JBV{} and William Myers (University of Oxford).

The work in this chapter forms the subject of two publications:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \fullcite{Yong2021AC}
    \item \fullcite{Verstraete2022CC}
\end{itemize}
