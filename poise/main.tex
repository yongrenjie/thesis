\chapter{POISE}
\label{chpt:poise}

This chapter describes the development of software for on-the-fly optimisation of NMR experimental parameters, titled POISE (\textit{Parameter Optimisation by Iterative Spectral Evaluation}).
The primary benefit of this is that parameters may be adjusted for individual spectrometers and samples, which may vary greatly in their chemical properties.
POISE is primarily written in Python 3.
In this chapter, I first provide some details about the implementation of POISE.
The bulk of the text which follows is devoted to a number of applications in liquid-state NMR spectroscopy.
At the end, the extension of the concept of on-the-fly optimisation to ESR spectroscopy is also briefly discussed: I contributed code for this, but the experimental ESR work and data analysis were carried out by Jean-Baptiste Verstraete (University of Oxford).

The work in this chapter forms the subject of two publications:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \fullcite{Yong2021AC}
    \item (JBV et al., manuscript submitted)
\end{itemize}
