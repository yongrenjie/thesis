\subsection{Water suppression}
\label{subsec:poise__solvsupp}

The suppression of solvent signals is one of the most important techniques in modern NMR, especially in cases where solvent deuteration is not a viable strategy (e.g.\ when exchangeable protons must be observed).\autocite{Zheng2010PNMRS,Giraudeau2015M}
Here, we specifically seek to optimise the 1D NOESY experiment with presaturation\autocite{Mckay2011CMR} (\cref{fig:poise_solvsupp_pulseq}): although this sequence is popular, its performance can depend on at least four parameters, namely the transmitter offset, presaturation power, the NOE mixing time, and the presaturation duration or recovery delay.
In this section, I use the symbols $\nu_\text{tx}$, $k_\text{ps}$, $\taum$, and $\taur$ to respectively refer to these four parameters: the corresponding TopSpin parameters are \texttt{O1}, \texttt{CNST20}, \texttt{D8}, and \texttt{D1}.

        Presaturation of the water resonance is applied during the recovery delay as well as the NOE mixing time.
        Phase cycling is performed with $\phi_1 = (x, -x)$, $\phi_2 = (x, x, -x, -x, y, y, -y, -y)$, and $\phi_\text{rec} = (x, -x, -x, x, y, -y, -y, y)$.
        Gradient amplitudes are $(g_1, g_2) = (50\%, -10\%)$.
        Boxes labelled with `presat.' indicates periods of weak presaturation.

\subsubsection{Optimisation setup}

In a similar style to the PSYCHE optimisations (\cref{subsec:poise__psyche}), a series of optimisations with increasing numbers of parameters were run.
However, in this case, the cost function is far easier to construct and far less noisy: we can simply integrate the water peak, which was defined to be the region of the spectrum between 4.65 and \qty{4.75}{\ppm}, and use that (or its absolute value) as the cost function.
In practice, because the phase of the water peak can vary rather unpredictably, I preferred to reuse the sum-of-squares cost function $f_\text{sos}$ (\cref{eq:sos_cost_function}).
Squaring each point of the spectrum not only accounts for the possible sign changes from out-of-phase peaks, but also more strongly penalises intense absorption-mode water peaks.%
\footnote{Dispersion-mode peaks are possibly more problematic because of their long `tails'. In hindsight, I could have considered trying the \texttt{minabsint} cost function instead (\cref{eq:minabsint}). However, in practice this did not seem to matter very much: all of these cost functions do ultimately share the same goal, i.e.\ to reduce the intensity of the water peak.}

One drawback of the water suppression optimisation is that the phase cycle of the 1D NOESY is integral to its performance: thus, several scans must be used for a reliable cost function to be obtained, making for relatively long optimisations.
In this case, I used \texttt{DS=2} and \texttt{NS=4}.

For these optimisations, I used a sample of rodent urine in \ch{D2O}, which was kindly provided by Abi Yates and Fay Probert (both University of Oxford).



\subsubsection{Optimisation results}

As before, I first provide a `summary' table comparing the optimisations with different numbers of parameters (\cref{tbl:poise_solvsupp_summary}).
From this, we see a similar story to before, in that optimising more parameters takes more time but leads to larger decreases in the cost function.
Individual details of each set of optimisations are given in \cref{tbl:poise_solvsupp1p,tbl:poise_solvsupp2p,tbl:poise_solvsupp3p,tbl:poise_solvsupp4p}.

The corresponding spectra post-optimisation are shown in \cref{fig:poise_solvsupp_spec}.
Clearly, the optimisations succeed in reducing the size of the water peak, especially the four-parameter optimisation.
However, perhaps equally importantly, the doublet at \qty{4.56}{\ppm} is unaffected by the optimisation.
Since the cost function does not actually check for the retention of peaks outside the target window, it is in principle possible that the optimisation will converge to parameters which achieve excellent water suppression but also cause nearby peaks to be lost.
This possibility is averted here by setting a conservative upper bound of \qty{55}{\Hz} on the presaturation power $k_\text{ps}$: this avoids inadvertently saturating nearby resonances.

In fact, it may be justifiable in this case to run a long, four-parameter optimisation (which takes around 30 minutes), especially if many samples are to be run using the same optimised water suppression parameters.
However, for more routine usage, it is probably preferable to limit the number of parameters being optimised to two.

\subsubsection{Optimisation on a sucrose sample}

The water suppression optimisations shown above were in fact first developed and evaluated on a sample of sucrose in 90\% \ch{H2O}/10\% \ch{D2O}.
This sample is less `interesting' in that there are no resonances close to the water peak, and I also did not perform replicates of each optimisation run (this data never made it into the POISE paper).
Nevertheless, I still believe it is still worth adding the results here, as they demonstrate that the optimisation procedure can be easily applied to different samples.

In this case, the one-parameter optimisation seemed to have no significant effect on the result: this is possibly because the initial value chosen for that single parameter (the transmitter offset) already happened to be an optimum.
However, the two- through four-parameter optimisations all yielded significant improvements in the water suppression (\cref{fig:poise_solvsupp_sucrose_spec}).
