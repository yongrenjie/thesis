\section{Technical overview}
\label{sec:poise__technical}

In this section, I first cover the general principles underlying, and the implementation of, POISE.
The basic operation of POISE is summarised in FIG, which is essentially a generalised version of the pure shift optimisations carried out in \cref{sec:pureshift__optimisation}.

\end{figure}

Almost all aspects of this can be customised by the user, which I will now describe.
I make a distinction here between an optimisation \textit{routine}, as well as the \textit{settings} used to run these routines.
Routines consist of a series of predefined variables, such as the parameter(s) to be optimised: however, these may be optimised in different \textit{ways}, which is where the settings come in.
When discussing individual applications in \cref{sec:poise__applications}, I will make repeated reference to these components of an optimisation.
