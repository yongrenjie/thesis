\section{Technical overview}
\label{sec:poise__technical}

In this section, I first cover the general principles underlying, and the implementation of, POISE.
The basic operation of POISE is summarised in the flowchart of \cref{fig:poise_flowchart}: this is a generalised version of the pure shift optimisations carried out in \cref{sec:pureshift__optimisation}.
Almost all aspects of this can be customised by the user, as will be described.

I begin by drawing a distinction between an optimisation \textit{routine}, as well as the \textit{way} in which these routines can be run (\cref{fig:poise_ingredients}).
Routines consist of a series of predefined variables, such as the parameter(s) to be optimised: however, these may be optimised in different ways, which is where the experiment used to perform the optimisation, as well as other options, come in.
These `ingredients' of an optimisation will be repeatedly referred to in the discussion of individual applications in \cref{sec:poise__applications}.
