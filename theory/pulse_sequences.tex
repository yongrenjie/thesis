\section{Pulse sequences}
\label{sec:theory__pulse_sequences}

It is impossible to provide a full overview of all, or even most, of the major NMR experiments in widespread use; the reader is directed to other books for this purpose.\autociteset{textbooks-experiments}
I seek only to (somewhat briefly) explain the general structure of one- and two-dimensional Fourier transform experiments, and in particular, how the formalisms developed in previous sections can be used to analyse and simulate such experiments.
