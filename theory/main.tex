\chapter{NMR theory}
\label{chpt:theory}

In the opening chapter of this thesis, I provide an overview of basic NMR theory, specifically, the dynamics of quantum systems containing one or more spin-\half{} particles.
Starting from the Schr\"odinger equation, I progressively develop the formalisms used in the analysis and simulation of simple NMR experiments.
The important product operator formalism, used throughout this thesis, is exemplified through a small number of 1D and 2D experiments.

Note that this is not designed to be an exhaustive account of magnetic resonance theory; the reader is directed to a suitable textbook on these topics\autociteset{textbooks-theory}.
