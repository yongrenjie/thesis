I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly throughâ€”and very good lists they were---very well chosen, and very neatly arranged \ldots{} But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience.

In the opening chapter of this thesis, I provide an overview of basic NMR theory, specifically, the dynamics of quantum systems containing one or more spin-\half{} particles.
Starting from the Schr\"odinger equation, I progressively develop the rotating frame and density operator formalisms used in the analysis and simulation of simple NMR experiments.
The important product operator formalism, used throughout this thesis, is exemplified through a selection of 1D and 2D experiments.
Since 2D experiments form a very large part of this thesis, I also discuss a number of general principles in 2D NMR.

Note that this chapter is not intended to be an exhaustive account of magnetic resonance theory; for more complete coverage, the reader is directed to a suitable textbook\autociteset{textbooks-theory}.
