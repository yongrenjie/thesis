\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:pureshift/introduction}

\textit{Pure shift NMR} refers to the technique of acquiring NMR spectra free of multiplet structure, such that every chemical environment gives rise to a singlet.\autocite{Zangger2015PNMRS}
To accomplish this, the effect of both heteronuclear and homonuclear couplings must be removed.
If only heteronuclear couplings exist, as is typically the case with dilute nuclei such as \carbon{}, then this is trivially accomplished by decoupling during the acquisition period.
However, removing \textit{homonuclear} couplings is a substantially more difficult task, as decoupling cannot be applied on the same radiofrequency channel as the signal is being detected on.
Therefore, in practice, the term `pure shift' is only used in the context of solution-state homonuclear decoupling.
Although pure shift techniques can be applied to any NMR-active nucleus, \proton{} is by far the most important, due to the abundance of \proton{}--\proton{} couplings in typical molecules.
