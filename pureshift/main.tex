\chapter{Pure shift NMR}
\label{chpt:pureshift}

\textit{Pure shift} NMR refers to the technique of acquiring NMR spectra free of multiplet structure, such that every chemical environment gives rise to a singlet.\autocite{Zangger2015PNMRS,Castanar2017MRC}
In the context of this thesis, we use the term `pure shift' exclusively to refer to broadband homodecoupled \proton{} spectra.
Here, `broadband' means that the couplings are removed from the entire spectrum, as opposed to just a subset of it (which can be accomplished through band-selective refocusing).
`Homodecoupled' refers to the fact that the primary target here is the removal of homonuclear couplings, which cannot be done simply through decoupling during acquisition.
Finally, although pure shift techniques can be applied to any nuclide, \proton{} spectra are of greatest interest because of the narrow chemical shift range of \proton{} which often leads to peak overlap.
