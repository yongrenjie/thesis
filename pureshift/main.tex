\chapter{Pure shift NMR}
\label{chpt:pureshift}

\textit{Pure shift} NMR refers to the technique of acquiring NMR spectra free of multiplet structure, such that every chemical environment gives rise to a singlet.\autocite{Zangger2015PNMRS,Castanar2017MRC}
In the context of this thesis, we use the term `pure shift' exclusively to refer to broadband homodecoupled \proton{} spectra.
Here, `broadband' means that the couplings are removed from the entire spectrum, as opposed to just a subset of it (which can be accomplished through band-selective refocusing).
`Homodecoupled' refers to the fact that the primary target here is the removal of homonuclear couplings, which cannot be done simply through decoupling during acquisition.
Finally, although pure shift techniques can be applied to any nuclide, \proton{} spectra are of greatest interest because of the narrow chemical shift range of \proton{} which often leads to peak overlap.
(Another prominent case is \carbon{} pure shift NMR in isotopically enriched molecules, but this is not within the scope of this thesis.)

In this chapter, I first cover the theory underpinning, and a brief history of, pure shift experiments.
I then describe a variety of approaches aimed at increasing the quality of pure shift experiments: this is measured both in terms of \textit{sensitivity} as well as \textit{purity}, i.e.\ the lack of spectral artefacts arising from imperfect decoupling.
In all cases, we compare these against the state-of-the-art PSYCHE pure shift method.
Finally, I end with a section discussing the combination of pure shift diffusion spectroscopy---formally a pseudo-3D experiment---with the use of ultrafast (single-scan) NMR techniques to collapse the diffusion dimension.
This project was carried out in collaboration with Jean-Nicolas Dumez (University of Nantes).
