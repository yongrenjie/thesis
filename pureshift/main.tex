\chapter{Pure shift NMR}
\label{chpt:pureshift}

\textit{Pure shift} NMR refers to the technique of acquiring NMR spectra free of multiplet structure, such that every chemical environment gives rise to a singlet.\autocite{Zangger2015PNMRS,Castanar2017MRC}
In the context of this thesis, I use the term `pure shift' exclusively to refer to broadband homodecoupled \proton{} spectra.
Here, `broadband' means that the couplings are removed from the \textit{entire spectrum}, as opposed to just a specific region (which thus excludes band-selective refocusing techniques).
`Homodecoupled' refers to the removal of \textit{homonuclear} couplings: unlike heteronuclear decoupling, this cannot be done during the acquisition period as the application of RF pulses will destroy the desired signal itself.
Finally, although pure shift techniques can be applied to any nuclide, \proton{} spectra are of greatest interest because of two factors: firstly, the narrow chemical shift range of \proton{} which often leads to peak overlap; and secondly, the abundance of \proton{}--\proton{} couplings in typical organic molecules.

In the first two sections, I first cover the theory underpinning, and a brief history of, pure shift experiments.
I then describe my work towards increasing the quality of pure shift experiments: this is measured both in terms of \textit{sensitivity} as well as \textit{purity}, i.e.\ the lack of spectral artefacts arising from imperfect decoupling.
Each of the approaches described here is compared against the PSYCHE pure shift method, which is the current state of the art.
Finally, I end with a section discussing the combination of pure shift diffusion spectroscopy---formally a pseudo-3D experiment---with the use of ultrafast NMR techniques to collapse the diffusion dimension.
This last project was carried out in collaboration with Jean-Nicolas Dumez (University of Nantes).
