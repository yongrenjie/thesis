\section{Pure shift in practice}
\label{sec:pureshift__intro_practice}

The previous section described the underlying theory used for analysing PSEs and showed how such an element could be used to record absorption-mode 2DJ spectra.
From this, one can obtain a pure shift spectrum through shearing and projection.
However, this is only an \textit{indirect} route to a pure shift spectrum.
In this section, we will tackle the main question of how pure shift experiments may be \textit{directly} acquired.
Following this, I cover several examples of PSEs reported in the literature.
This selection is not exhaustive: I only choose to cover a handful of PSEs which \textit{specifically} accomplish the transformations listed in \cref{eq:pure_shift_requirement_spin1,eq:pure_shift_requirement_spin2}.
