\section{Pure shift in practice}
\label{sec:pureshift__intro_practice}

In the previous section, I described the underlying theory used for analysing PSEs and showed how such an element could be used to record absorption-mode 2DJ spectra.
From this, one can obtain a pure shift spectrum through shearing and projection.
However, this is only an \textit{indirect} route to a pure shift spectrum.
In this section, we will tackle the main question of how pure shift experiments may be \textit{directly} acquired using a PSE.
Following this, I cover several examples of PSEs reported in the literature.
This is not an exhaustive survey of pure shift methods: I only choose to cover a handful of PSEs which specifically accomplish the transformations listed in \cref{eq:pure_shift_requirement_spin1,eq:pure_shift_requirement_spin2}.
Thus, for example, constant-time techniques (which are widely used to suppress \carbon{}--\carbon{} couplings in labelled biomolecules) are not mentioned.
