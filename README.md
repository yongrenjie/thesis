# thesis

My DPhil thesis: *Optimising NMR Spectroscopy through Method and Software Development*.

You will need the *Minion Pro*, *Minion Math*, and *Roboto Mono* fonts to compile this correctly (and you will need to point to their correct paths in the preamble).
Roboto Mono is open-source (you can obtain it from e.g. Google Fonts), but the other two are proprietary, so for obvious reasons I don't upload these with the repository.
The final compiled PDF is provided here, though.

Figures are provided as png files, and svg for anything made in Inkscape.
The source code for penguins/matplotlib plots is included.
However, to run these, you will need my processed NMR data, which exists only on an SSD of mine.
