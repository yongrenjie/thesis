# thesis

Jon's DPhil thesis.

Note that you will need the *Minion Pro* fonts to compile this correctly (and you will need to point to their correct paths in the preamble).
For obvious reasons I don't upload these with the repository.

Figures are provided as png files but to regenerate them from the scripts you will need access to my NMR data.

Don't expect any kind of sensible commit message or frequency.
I mainly have this online just in case of catastrophic failure, not because I want to keep a history of how my thesis has evolved over time.
