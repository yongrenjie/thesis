\section{Discussion of individual modules}
\label{sec:noah__modules}

The GENESIS website makes it possible to easily implement and distribute entirely new modules, as well as updates to old modules: simply changing the underlying \texttt{NOAHModule} objects is sufficient to propagate changes to all supersequences generated using those modules.
In this section, I discuss a number of new pulse sequence developments made in the course of my DPhil; all of these have been successfully implemented in GENESIS and are available to download.
