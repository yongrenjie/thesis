\section{Discussion of individual modules}
\label{sec:noah__modules}

The GENESIS website makes it possible to easily implement and distribute entirely new modules, as well as updates to old modules: simply changing the underlying \texttt{NOAHModule} objects is sufficient to propagate changes to all supersequences generated using those modules.
In this section, I discuss a number of new pulse sequence developments made in the course of my DPhil; all of these have been successfully implemented in GENESIS and are available to download.

With regards to sensitivity analyses, since this chapter discusses the design of \textit{individual modules}, I have chosen to focus almost entirely on the SNR factor $A$: this is an intrinsic property of the module.
In contrast, the quantities $\rho_t$ and $\varepsilon_t$ depend on the supersequence within which the module is used, and can be improved trivially by adding more modules to the supersequence under consideration.
These numbers reflect the utility of the NOAH \textit{technique}, but are not relevant to the individual modules from which they are constructed.
