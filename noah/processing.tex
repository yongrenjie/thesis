\subsection{Processing improvements}
\label{subsec:noah__genesis_processing}

Finally, I touch on a few small improvements in processing NOAH data: these are not strictly made possible by the GENESIS website, but having a unified source for pulse programmes and processing scripts does make it substantially easier to propagate these developments.


\subsubsection{AU script processing}

When processing NOAH experiments, the first step is to split up the FIDs of different modules into different files: this is done by the \texttt{splitx\_au} AU programme.
However, after that is done, \texttt{splitx\_au} \textit{also} calls on auxiliary AU programmes to process each of the resulting datasets.
Each module is associated with a specific auxiliary AU programme: for example, HSQC data is processed with \texttt{noah\_hsqc}, COSY data with \texttt{noah\_cosy}, and so on.

Previously, these auxiliary AU programmes had to be specified manually using the \texttt{USERP1} through \texttt{USERP5} processing parameters, which respectively apply to the first through fifth modules in a supersequence.
Although this was a perfectly serviceable setup, I realised that it was a source of annoyance when running multiple different supersequences, as modules would often be processed incorrectly if the processing parameters were inadvertently copied.
Even when just running a single supersequence, this was still an extra cognitive load, especially for users who may not have been familiar with NOAH experiments.

Since the pulse programme specifies which modules are run, and the `correct' processing parameters also depend on the modules, it stands to reason that the processing parameters can be encoded in the pulse programme itself.
Thus, all GENESIS pulse programmes contain a line near the bottom specifying which AU programmes are to be used for each of the modules present.
I also modified the \texttt{splitx\_au} AU programme to parse the pulse programme for this extra information.
Thus, the \texttt{USERP1}, \ldots parameters no longer need to be specified, as long as a GENESIS pulse programme and a recent version of \texttt{splitx\_au} are used.
These parameters still serve a purpose, though; if they are non-empty, they will override the `default' processing instructions found in the pulse programme.
It is therefore possible for advanced users to customise the processing being carried out.
This also maintains backwards compatibility with older versions of pulse programmes and \texttt{splitx\_au}.


\subsubsection{Non-uniform sampling}

Another small improvement relates to the implementation of non-uniform sampling (NUS) in NOAH supersequences.
Because the indirect dimension in NOAH pulse programmes is generated through explicit looping (\cref{lst:genesis_looping}), instead of the \texttt{mc} macro used in most 2D experiments, the standard NUS implementation in TopSpin cannot be used.
The original solution\autocite{Claridge2019MRC} relied on explicitly defining a list of $t_1$ increments to sample (stored as the \texttt{VCLIST} parameter), and modifying the pulse programme to only use $t_1$ values from this list using a Python script (\texttt{noah\_nus.py}).
This required storing two copies of the same pulse programme, one with NUS and one without.
Furthermore, enabling NUS was a (relatively) irreversible process: NUS could not be disabled without manually resetting the pulse programme and other parameters.

There is no way to circumvent the requirement for the \texttt{VCLIST} parameter, but in GENESIS pulse programmes, I opted to no longer create a new pulse programme: instead, NUS is implemented as an acquisition flag which can be toggled.
This solves both of the above problems: there is no need to store two versions of the same pulse programme, and it is possible to seamlessly switch between non-uniform and uniform sampling as desired.%

Unfortunately, this change is slightly more problematic than the \texttt{splitx\_au} change: this new NUS implementation is not backwards-compatible, so requires a new NUS setup script which I have called \texttt{noah\_nus2.py}.
This script cannot be used with old pulse programmes, and the old script cannot be used with GENESIS pulse programmes.%
\footnote{Also, there were still some bugs in the new NUS implementation right up until August 2022, so this change was not as smooth-sailing as I had hoped for.}
Nevertheless, it does represent a real improvement over the previous implementation: the GENESIS website also helps to make the changeover as smooth as possible.
