\chapter{NOAH}
\label{chpt:noah}

This final---and long---chapter describes my work on \textit{NOAH} (NMR by Ordered Acquisition using \proton{} detection) \textit{supersequences}, pulse sequences which record multiple 2D datasets (\textit{`modules'}) in the time required for one.
This is an attractive NMR technique for several reasons: the time savings are clearly a key factor, but the flexibility of being able to combine almost any set of modules also makes NOAH supersequences applicable to a variety of contexts.

I begin by introducing the concepts underlying NOAH supersequences, as well as a general discussion of the time savings (and sensitivity per unit time) benefits thus realised.
I then describe the GENESIS (GENEration of Supersequences In Silico) website, which allows users to generate Bruker pulse programmes for almost every imaginable NOAH supersequence.
After this, my work on various aspects of the actual sequences themselves is described, with a special focus on newly developed and/or improved modules.
Finally, the design of `parallel' supersequences which use interleaved and/or time-shared modules is discussed.

This work was done in close collaboration with \EK{} (Bruker UK).
However, all results and analysis shown in this chapter are mine, unless explicitly stated.
The work in this chapter forms the subject of several publications:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \fullcite{Yong2021JMR}
    \item \fullcite{Kupce2021JACSA}
    \item \fullcite{Yong2022AC}
    \item \fullcite{Yong2022_ABBS}
\end{itemize}

The material in the introductory sections also closely follow two reviews which I have contributed to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \fullcite{Kupce2021NRMP}
    \item \fullcite{Yong2022RSCBook}
\end{itemize}
