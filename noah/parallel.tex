\section{Parallel and generalised NOAH supersequences}
\label{sec:noah__parallel}

To conclude this chapter, I discuss how \textit{multiple} NOAH supersequences may be run in parallel in order to obtain yet more data from a single experiment.
As of the time of writing, current software limitations in TopSpin limit NOAH supersequences to a maximum of five modules.

\todo{Would like to get around this...}

\todo{Can combine with idea of time-shared NMR...}

\todo{No extra time savings as they arise from horizontal combination, not vertical}
