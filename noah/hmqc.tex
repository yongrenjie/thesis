\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\nitrogen{}}{15N} HMQC}
\label{subsec:noah__hmqc}

In \cref{subsec:noah__sehsqc_n}, I will discuss how the sensitivity-enhanced HSQC modules developed above may be adapted into \proton{}--\nitrogen{} experiments.
However, before that, I make a slight detour to cover the \nitrogen{} HMQC experiment, which (up until my DPhil) was the experiment of choice for detecting one-bond \proton{}--\nitrogen{} correlations.

        Phase cycling is performed with $\phi_1 = (x, -x)$, $\phi_2 = (x, x, -x, -x)$, and $\phi_\text{rec} = (x, -x, -x, x)$.
        The delay $\Delta$ is set to $1 / (4 \cdot \oneJ{NH})$.
        Gradient amplitudes are: $g_1 = 80\%$; $g_2 = \pm 32.4\%$; $g_2' = g_2/2$.

The HMQC module is based on the ASAP-HMQC reported by Kup{\v{c}}e and Freeman\autocite{Kupce2007MRC}, which used a symmetric gradient scheme similar to that in the seHSQC modules previously described (\cref{fig:noah_hmqc_2grad}).
However, in the NOAH module\autocite{Kupce2017ACIE}, bipolar gradient pulse pairs were placed before and after $t_1$ (\cref{fig:noah_hmqc_4grad}).
This was likely implemented in order to allow the final gradient, $g_2$, to have as large an amplitude as possible.
In heteronuclear experiments, this final gradient is particularly important for dephasing bulk magnetisation which is transverse just prior to detection (due to pulse imperfections or relaxation).
If this gradient is too weak, this unwanted magnetisation will be incompletely dephased, leading to artefacts in the resulting spectrum.

Strategies to maximise this gradient amplitude are particularly crucial in \proton{}--\nitrogen{} experiments (as compared to \proton{}--\carbon{} experiments) for two reasons.
Firstly, the natural abundance of \nitrogen{} (0.36\%) is even smaller than \carbon{} (1.1\%), meaning that better suppression must be achieved in order for the artefacts to not obscure the signal.
Secondly, the gyromagnetic ratio of \nitrogen{} is also smaller: thus, since $g_2/g_1 \propto \gammaN/\gammaH$, an unmodified pulse sequence will naturally have a smaller $g_2$.

In this respect, the four-gradient scheme in \cref{fig:noah_hmqc_4grad} is superior to the two-gradient scheme, because the gradient $g_2$ will have an amplitude of $4\gammaN g_1/\gammaH$.
However, when used in a NOAH supersequence, this leads to wing artefacts in downstream modules, since bulk \magnnot{N} magnetisation effectively does not experience any coherence order selection during $t_1$.
This motivates a return to the two-gradient scheme of \cref{fig:noah_hmqc_2grad}.
To compensate for the fact that the decoding gradient $g_2'$ has half of the amplitude of $g_2$, all CTP gradients were instead \textit{lengthened} from their usual duration of \qty{1}{\ms} to \qty{2.5}{\ms}.
This ensures that any stray transverse bulk magnetisation at the end of the HMQC module is effectively dephased.

The HMQC spectra thus obtained are shown in \cref{fig:hmqc_grad_spec}.
