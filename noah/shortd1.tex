\section{NOAH with short relaxation delays (???)}
\label{sec:noah__shortd1}

I did like one bit of work on this a while ago.
The idea is basically that the spectra are fine but SNR unsurprisingly suffers (in fact SNR/t also decreases).

It may be mildly interesting to compare this against the NORD experiments if I can get their pulse programmes to work\ldots{} I don't expect the NORD sensitivity to be amazing but it should in fact be better than just doing NOAH with short d1.

It may equally be viable to just leave this entire section out of the thesis as I don't think it adds much\ldots{}
