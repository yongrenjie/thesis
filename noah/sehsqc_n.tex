\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\nitrogen{}}{15N} sensitivity-enhanced HSQC}
\label{subsec:noah__sehsqc_n}

I now move on to the \nitrogen{} seHSQC experiment, which (for small molecules) is an improvement on the HMQC experiment for two reasons: firstly, the PEP transfer grants additional sensitivity (and can be optimised for \ch{NH} groups); and secondly, splittings due to $\nJ{HH}$ are not observed in the indirect dimension.
