\section{GENESIS: automated pulse programme creation}
\label{sec:noah__genesis}

In this section, I discuss the development of the GENESIS (GENEration of Supersequences In Silico) website (\cref{fig:genesis_frontpage}).%
\footnote{Although placing this section first may at first glance appear to be nonchronological, in that the GENESIS paper\autocite{Yong2022AC} was published later than much of the other work in this chapter, an early version of the GENESIS tool was in fact created much earlier (by July 2020).}
As its name suggests, GENESIS is a tool which programmatically generates (Bruker) pulse programmes for arbitrary NOAH supersequences.
The website also provides extensive instructions on acquiring and processing NOAH data.
The present version of GENESIS is available at \url{https://nmr-genesis.co.uk}; the source code can also be obtained from \url{https://github.com/yongrenjie/genesis}.
