\section{GENESIS: automated pulse programme creation}
\label{sec:noah__genesis}

From the preceding discussion, it is clear that modules which use different magnetisation pools can be combined almost at will.
It does not matter \textit{what} modules they are, merely what magnetisation pools they consume (and preserve).
Thus, for example, the \noah{S,C} supersequence can in fact be generalised to any \magn{C} module plus any \magnnot{C} module.

Very broadly speaking, we may define a generic supersequence as having any or all of the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a HMBC module, which actually uses \magn{!X} magnetisation but can be placed at the front as discussed in the \noah{B,S,C} example above;
    \item a \magn{N} module;
    \item one or more \magn{C} modules (it is possible to partition the \magn{C} magnetisation pool between two modules, as will be discussed in \cref{subsec:noah__hsqctocsy});
    \item one or more \magn{!X} modules which consume bulk magnetisation.
\end{itemize}

Taking into account some of the new modules which were developed in the course of my DPhil (\cref{sec:noah__modules}), this generic structure means that there are over 4000 `viable' supersequences.
(`Non-viable' sequences would be those which have undesirable drawbacks: for example, wrongly ordered modules like in a \noah{C,S} supersequence.)

\todo{
subsections: motivation / implementation details / processing improvements?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item cannot generate all pulse programmes
        \item changes to modules cannot be easily propagated (scaling issue)
        \item unchronological to cover this first as it incorporates work from later sections, but sets the scene for the rest (not entirely true, it just wasn't public)
        \item implementation details (maybe this should be a subsection)
        \item centralised source for scripts etc - processing improvements, NUS
    \end{itemize}

emphasise that this bridges the gap between `concept of NOAH' and actually using it in practice

not a true scientific development but still integral
