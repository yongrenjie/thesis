\section{GENESIS: automated pulse programme creation}
\label{sec:noah__genesis}

I think it makes sense to start with GENESIS\autocite{Yong2022AC}; that way everything else can be placed in context.

It's true that this was a full paper, but it included a lot of stuff which wasn't about the website itself---these will go into later sections.
