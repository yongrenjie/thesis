\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:noah__introduction}

The opening sections for the NOAH chapter will likely be very similar to the recent RSC book chapter.
That was written quite recently so reflects my current perspective quite accurately, and I am quite happy with the way it was laid out (in contrast to the \textit{Nature Reviews Methods Primers} work).

Magnetisation pools, etc.
