\subsection{HSQC-COSY}
\label{subsec:noah__hsqccosy}

One downside of the HSQC-TOCSY experiment discussed in the previous section is the (largely) indiscriminate transfer of magnetisation effected by the DIPSI mixing
It is difficult to determine how many transfer steps give rise to each peak, unless several HSQC-TOCSY spectra with different mixing times are recorded, which is a time-consuming process.%
\footnote{Of course, as per the previous section, this could be done in a NOAH supersequence where each HSQC-TOCSY spectrum is assigned a fraction of the \magn{C} magnetisation. However, one must be wary of stretching the same magnetisation pool too thinly between many different modules: the resulting decrease in sensitivity may lead to peaks being lost.}

For unambiguous spectral assignment, it may be preferable to have a mixing process which only effects coherence transfer across a single coupling: this can be described as an HSQC-COSY experiment.
Similar experiments, including the H2BC\autocite{Nyberg2005JACS,Nyberg2005MRC}, 2BOB/H2OBC\autocite{Kupce2017MRC}, and HMQC-COSY\autocite{Hu2011JBNMR} have previously been proposed: the 2BOB experiment in particular has previously been incorporated in NOAH supersequences\autocite{Kupce2019JMR}.
These often use constant-time techniques in order to remove $\nJ{HH}$ splittings and minimise linewidths in the indirect dimension; however, the drawback of this approach is that peak \textit{amplitudes} are modulated by $\nJ{HH}$.
Furthermore, it is not generally possible to obtain absorption-mode lineshapes for all peaks in the spectrum: typically the `direct' responses are in-phase absorption, and `indirect' responses antiphase dispersion.
(Here, the terms in-phase and antiphase are used with respect to $\nJ{HH}$; specifically, for the indirect peaks, this refers to the `active' coupling over which the coherence was transferred).


\subsubsection{HSQC-CLIP-COSY}

    \caption[HSQC-CLIP-COSY experiment]{
        HSQC-CLIP-COSY experiment with product operator analysis for the HSQC-COSY signal derived from the \magn{C} magnetisation, as well as the bulk \magnnot{C} magnetisation.
        Both the `direct', HSQC-type peaks, as well as the `indirect' responses arising from coherence transfer in the perfect echo block, are analysed.
        The shorthand notation for product operators is expanded here to deal with a three-spin $IKS$ system, where $I$ and $S$ are a mutually bonded \proton{}--\carbon{} pair as usual, and $K$ is a `remote' proton coupled to $I$.
        Terms with asterisks are on spin $K$; thus, for example, $zx*$ refers to an $I_zK_x$ term.
        The delay $\tau$ is chosen to be $1 / (4 \cdot \sum \nJ{HH})$; typically, this sum of couplings is set as \qty{30}{Hz}, leading to a value of $\tau = \qty{8.33}{\ms}$.
        The ZQF gradient $g_3$ should be calibrated as per Thrippleton et al.\autocite{Thrippleton2003ACIE}; $g_4$ is a purge gradient with arbitrary amplitude.

These problems are circumvented by the HSQC-CLIP-COSY experiment\autocite{Gyongyosi2018CPC,Gyongyosi2021AC}, where the basic HSQC experiment is combined with clean in-phase (CLIP) coherence transfer using a perfect echo\autocite{Aguilar2012CC,Parella2019MRC,Koos2016ACIE} and ZQF\autocite{Thrippleton2003ACIE} (\cref{fig:hsqcc_clip_po}).
The use of a HSQC-type experiment means that $\nJ{HH}$ does not evolve during $t_1$, and the CLIP transfer ensures that all peaks have in-phase absorption lineshapes.
Much like the HSQC-TOCSY experiment before it, this experiment may be implemented with direct/indirect response editing: it is this version of the experiment which is shown in \cref{fig:hsqcc_clip_po}.%
\footnote{Note that this editing is orthogonal to \textit{multiplicity editing}, which labels both direct and indirect responses with a sign that depends on the multiplicity of the \carbon{} nucleus detected in $t_1$. The addition of multiplicity editing leads to highly confusing spectra, so is ignored here---although the option to do so \textit{is} provided in the GENESIS pulse programmes if the user so desires.}
If this editing is not desired, then the final $2\Delta$--\ang{180}($I,S$)--$2\Delta$ spin echo can simply be reduced to a minimal gradient echo, i.e.\ $\varepsilon$--\ang{180}($I$)--$\varepsilon$.

Unfortunately, the HSQC-CLIP-COSY experiment does not preserve \magnnot{C} magnetisation; thus, it cannot be directly used in a NOAH supersequence without sacrificing the sensitivity of terminal homonuclear modules.
In particular, the ZQF used in the HSQC-CLIP-COSY experiment dephases all magnetisation that is not along $z$.
If we wished to retain \magnnot{C} magnetisation, it would therefore have to (somehow) be placed along $z$ during this period, and would have to be differentiated from the HSQC-COSY signal \textit{after} the ZQF, which is not possible.%
\footnote{To be precise, although the $\oneJ{CH}$ Hamiltonian could be used to separate bulk magnetisation and the HSQC-type `direct' responses, the `indirect' responses cannot be differentiated.}
On top of that, the experiment also cannot be modified to provide partial excitation of \magn{C} magnetisation, which limits the ways in which it can be combined with other \carbon{} modules.


\subsubsection{Double spin echo HSQC-COSY}

    \label{fig:hsqcc_dse_po}
\end{figure}

Before tackling these problems directly, I discuss a simpler version of the HSQC-COSY experiment, which uses a simple spin echo for $\nJ{HH}$ evolution instead of the perfect echo of the CLIP version.
Together with the final $4\Delta$ spin echo, this forms a `double spin echo' (DSE) version of the HSQC-COSY experiment (\cref{fig:hsqcc_dse_po}): the `double' refers only to the mixing section after $t_1$.
The removal of the CLIP coherence transfer element leads to mixed lineshapes in this experiment, where the direct responses are (mostly) in-phase absorption, and the indirect responses (mostly) antiphase dispersion.%
\footnote{The qualifier \textit{mostly} is required because evolution of $\nJ{HH}$ during the final spin echo leads to mixtures of in-phase absorption and antiphase dispersion. This evolution is generally small, though, because $2\Delta$ is smaller than $\tau$.}

Like the CLIP version, this DSE experiment does not preserve bulk magnetisation; it is also incompatible with partial \magn{C} excitation.
However, it does provide more raw sensitivity than the CLIP version: in the CLIP version, any antiphase signal at the end of the perfect echo is destroyed by the ZQF.
All of this available signal is sampled in the DSE version, but this comes with a cost of not having pure absorption lineshapes.

It should be mentioned that prepending this DSE HSQC-COSY with the ZIP element would in fact return the bulk \magnnot{C} magnetisation to $+z$ at the end of the sequence.
Unfortunately, I did not manage to test this experimentally.


\subsubsection{Triple spin echo HSQC-COSY}

    \label{fig:hsqcc_tse_po}
\end{figure}

In the DSE HSQC-COSY, the first of the two spin echoes after $t_1$ serves a dual purpose: $\oneJ{CH}$ is allowed to evolve for a duration of $\tau - (\tau - \Delta) + \Delta = 2\Delta$ (thus generating peaks which are in-phase with respect to $\oneJ{CH}$), and $\nJ{HH}$ evolves for the total duration of $2\tau$ (allowing coherence transfer to remote spins).
The triple spin echo (TSE) HSQC-COSY is derived from the DSE version by separating the first spin echo into two distinct parts: one for $\oneJ{CH}$ refocusing, and one for $\nJ{HH}$ evolution.
As shown by the product operator analysis in \cref{fig:hsqcc_tse_po_1}, this not only preserves the bulk \magnnot{C} magnetisation, but is also compatible with partial \magn{C} excitation.

The problem with the TSE version is the spectral quality: consider an even larger spin system of the form $\ch{S-I-K-L}$, where $\{I,K,L\}$ are \proton{} and $S\/$ is \carbon{}.
At the end of $t_1$, single-quantum magnetisation on spin $I\/$ is present.
Any evolution of $J_{IK}$ in the first spin echo (of duration $2\Delta$) leads to terms of the form $2I_yK_z$, and can then be transferred onto spin $K\/$ by the subsequent 90\rlap{\unit{\degree}}$_{x}$ pulse.
This magnetisation can then further evolve under $J_{KL}$ during the $2\tau$ spin echo, and then be transferred a \textit{second} time by the 90\rlap{\unit{\degree}}$_{-x}$ to spin $L$.
Since the intensity of this transfer pathway is proportional to $\sin(2\pi J_{IK}\Delta)$, these `relay' artefacts are especially prominent for large $J_{IK}$.

In order to suppress these, the experiment must be run a second time but with an additional \ang{180} \carbon{} pulse inserted during the second spin echo (\cref{fig:hsqcc_tse_po_2}).
Any magnetisation still on spin $I\/$ will therefore evolve under $\oneJ{CH}$ for a total period of $4\Delta$, leading to net inversion.
However, magnetisation which has already been transferred to spin $K\/$ at this point will not be inverted: it is this magnetisation which is responsible for the relay artefacts.
Therefore, by subtracting the two datasets (or equivalently, inverting the receiver phase and adding the two datasets), the desired peaks will be added up and the artefacts cancelled through subtraction.

The insertion of this \ang{180} pulse also causes any unexcited \magn{C} magnetisation to be inverted.
In order to ensure that this is returned to $+z$ at the end of the sequence (and not $-z$), the initial INEPT delay must be \textit{lengthened} instead of shortened, as per:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:delta_e_prime}
    \DeltaEp = \frac{2\Delta (\pi - \arcsin f)}{\pi},
\end{equation}
where, as before, $f\/$ is the proportion of magnetisation to be excited.
