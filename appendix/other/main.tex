\chapter{Other work}
\label{chpt:other}

I'm not sure I'll actually get to this, but I think it would be nice to write something about these, because a fair bit of `work' has gone into these.

My other big(-ish)  software projects were of course part of the thesis.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Project} & \textbf{File extensions included} & \textbf{Total lines of code} \\
        \midrule
        \texttt{nmrpoise} & \texttt{.py}, \texttt{.rst}, \texttt{.sh} & 6047 \\
        \texttt{genesis} & \texttt{.js}, \texttt{.ts}, \texttt{.html}, \texttt{.css}, \texttt{.sh} & 11330\footnote{Note that this includes \textit{a lot} of raw pulse programme text, which probably inflates this number quite a bit. To `compensate' for this, I didn't include any of the TopSpin processing scripts in the count.} \\
        \texttt{matlab\_nmr\_jy} & \texttt{.m}, \texttt{.py} & 7961\footnote{This includes some 800 lines of \texttt{fminlbfgs.m} which was taken from the Internet, although I did comb through it to correct some errors.} \\
        \texttt{penguins} & \texttt{.py}, \texttt{.rst} & 7129 \\
        \texttt{abbotsbury} & \texttt{.hs} & 5446 \\
        \texttt{nmrespy}\autocite{Hulse2022JMR} & \texttt{.py}, \texttt{.rst} & 19007 \\
        \texttt{spinach-2.6.5625}\autocite{Hogben2011JMR} & \texttt{.m} & 116443 \\
        \texttt{numpy}\autocite{Harris2020N} & \texttt{.py}, \texttt{.cpp}, \texttt{.c}, \texttt{.h}, \texttt{.f}, \texttt{.rst} & 685300 \\

    \caption[List of software projects]{Lines of source code in some of my software projects (plus a handful of others for comparison), as measured on 5th August 2022 on the \texttt{master} or \texttt{main} branches. Note that number of lines is a \textbf{very} poor metric for project size or complexity.}
